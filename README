The instruction above will generate the: sample-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war which can be deployed
in a tomcat server.

Setup instructions:

- Open an stormpath account.
- Get your API keys and place the file in a secure location. See http://www.stormpath.com/docs/get-api-key
- Register an application. See http://www.stormpath.com/docs/quickstart/register-app
- Create accounts for the created applications and assign them roles (e.g. admin or user).
- Create a properties file that will have at least the following two properties:

stormpath.apikey.location=<location of the apiKeys properties file>
stormpath.application.resturl=<REST URL of the stormpath application>

In the application-context.xml file (under src/amin/webapp/WEB-INF/spring) replace the

properties file in your local environment.
